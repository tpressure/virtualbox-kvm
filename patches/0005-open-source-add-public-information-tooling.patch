Subject: [PATCH] open-source: add public information/tooling

doc: Add readme for open-source release

The Readme is placed in the vboxsrc/ directory, so that is directly
included when shipping our vbox sources.

open-source: add github issue template

+# VirtualBox KVM
+
+This repository contains an adapted version of the open source virtualization
+tool VirtualBox called VirtualBox KVM.
+VirtualBox KVM uses Linux KVM as the underlying hypervisor.
+
+## What to expect
+
+The basic look and feel of VirtualBox KVM will be the same as with an
+conventional VirtualBox. The user is able to boot the same guest VMs in their
+existing VirtualBox configuration.
+
+Nonetheless, there are the following benefits of using VirtualBox KVM compared
+to the conventional VirtualBox:
+
+* VirtualBox can run in parallel to QEMU/KVM
+* VirtualBox kernel driver (`vboxdrv`) is not required
+* Modern virtualization features supported by KVM are automatically used (e.g.
+  APICv)
+* KVM is part of the Linux kernel and therefore always directly available with
+  every kernel update
+
+Due to the replacement of the underlying hypervisor, there will be differences
+in the guest performance. Performance differences heavily depend on the guest
+workload.
+
+## How to use
+
+There are no prebuilt packages of VirtualBox KVM and it needs to be build from
+source. The process of building VirtualBox from source can be found
+[on virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux%20build%20instructions) and only
+minor adjustments are required to build VirtualBox with KVM as a backend.
+
+After having all the prerequisites installed, the build process can be condensed
+to the following steps:
+
+```shell
+$ ./configure --with-kvm --disable-kmods --disable-docs --disable-hardening --disable-java
+$ source ./env.sh
+$ kmk
+$ out/linux.amd64/release/bin/VirtualBox
+```
+
+The noticeable difference to the official build process is the addition of
+`--with-kvm` when calling `./configure`.
+
+## Known issues and limitations
+
+* Currently, Intel x86_64 is the only supported host platform.
+  * AMD will most likely work too but is considered experimental at the moment.
+* Linux is required as a host operating system for building and running
+  VirtualBox KVM.
+* Starting with Intel Tiger Lake (11th Gen Core processors) or newer, split lock
+  detection must be turned off in the host system. This can be achieved using
+  the Linux kernel command line parameter `split_lock_detect=off` or using the
+  `split_lock_mitigate` sysctl.
+

+virtualization solutions, we are happy to provide guidance and engineering
+services. Please reach out to us via our
